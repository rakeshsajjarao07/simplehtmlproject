      <p>HTML5 <strong>Hypertext Markup Language 5</strong> is a markup language used for structuring and presenting hypertext documents on the World Wide Web. It was the fifth and final[4] major HTML version that is now a retired World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).</p>
